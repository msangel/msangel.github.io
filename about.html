            <p>
                The first pro&shy;gram I wrote in 14 years, since that time I am al&shy;ways in the area of com&shy;puter
                know&shy;ledge. I know how com&shy;puters work. I have a bach&shy;el&shy;or de&shy;gree in sys&shy;tem
                en&shy;gin&shy;eer&shy;ing. Be&shy;side uni&shy;versity courses, I was do&shy;ing a lot of self-edu&shy;ca&shy;tion
                in free time. Main top&shy;ics were: pro&shy;gram&shy;ming the&shy;ory, net&shy;work&shy;ing, se&shy;cur&shy;ity,
                math&shy;em&shy;at&shy;ics and mi&shy;cro&shy;elec&shy;tron&shy;ics. I am ori&shy;ented to learn&shy;ing
                something new. My huge ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence in IT al&shy;lows me to solve really com&shy;plex tasks
                at a reas&shy;on&shy;able time. So you can con&shy;tact me and give some work.

            <h4>Most important in work</h4>
            <p>Writing programs is not a target. Solve the customer needs is a target. You must not write the perfect
                code, you must write the code, that people do need now. And you must do this with responsibility.</p>

            <h4>Free as in speech</h4>
            <p>I love free software. Free software provides the ability to evolve for programs. It provides diversity of
                choices. It gives you a freedom to change the software according to your needs. </p>

            <h4>Hardest things</h4>
            <p>
                When someone asks me about hardest things in programming, I always remember the phrase by Phil Karlton:
                "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things."
